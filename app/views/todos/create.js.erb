//we parse in @todo from the create action as the local variable to the todo partial

//lets thrown in the debugger to actually confirm that this is where we land when we click the button
//now we know that the debugger was hit
//now that we are in the create.js.erb we have access to any instance variable created in the create action in
//the controller, so we can write javascript and embedded ruby code for the instances in the create action
// so we want to  use javascript to append the new todo to the <ul> tag
//we create an html to get the description and the priority from the db...
